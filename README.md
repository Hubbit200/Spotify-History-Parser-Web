# Spotify History Parser Web
 A web-based version of my [Spotify History Parser](https://github.com/Hubbit200/spotify-history-parser), along with some extra features!
 Makes use of the Spotify API and Wikidata SPARQL requests. Everything is calculated client-side so that your listen history never leaves your device.

## Check it out at
 [Web-based Spotify History Analyzer](https://leohumnew.com/spotify)

## Instructions:
1. Log in to Spotify in a web browser (the app does't have what you need)
2. Go to the privacy settings in your account area (top right of the Spotify home website once you've logged in, then around half way down the categories on the left)
3. Scroll down and click to download your data
4. Wait... Spotify usually seems to take around 2-6 days for it, but says it can take up to 30
5. You'll get an email saying your data is ready - download it!
6. Extract the downloaded folder
7. Go to the website (link above), and follow the instructions!
