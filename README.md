# Spotify History Parser Web
 🎧 Web application to analyse and view details about your Spotify music streaming history.

## Try It Out
 🌐 Live at [leohumnew.com/spotify](https://leohumnew.com/spotify)

## Instructions:
 📑 Instructions are also present on the website itself.
1. Follow the link on my website to the Spotify privacy settings (must be logged in).
2. Scroll down and click to download your account data.
3. Wait... Spotify usually seems to take around 1-2 days, but it can take up to 5.
5. You'll get an email saying your data is ready - download it!
6. Extract the downloaded folder.
7. Return to my Spotify History Parser and follow the instructions!

## Details
Makes use of the Spotify API for images and the Wikidata SPARQL API for artist information. Everything is calculated client-side so that your listen history never leaves your device.
Based on my previous [Spotify History Parser](https://github.com/Hubbit200/spotify-history-parser), but web-based and with extra features!
